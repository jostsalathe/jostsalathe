- 👋 Hi, I’m Jost Salathé
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of electronics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to design custom keyboards
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the above
- 📫 How to reach me: PMs aren't a thing, here... Need to think of something else...

You can also find some open source hardware I designed on [oshwlab.com/jostsalathe](https://oshwlab.com/jostsalathe).
